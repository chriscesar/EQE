# EQETool.R ####
## Ecological Quality Extent (EQE) tool to quantify the impacts and recovery of environmental indices
## A number of user-generated parameters are required to inform the spatial and temporal scales of pressures

## user inputs:
## use same symbology as the Cesar paper:

# Ecological quality dimension:
## Qmax is the maximum value of the index under reference conditions
## Qmin is the minimum value that the EQR will reach as a result of the disturbance

# Spatial dimension (Sp):
# calculated as the surface area of the ‘footprint’ of the pressure as a
# proportion of the assessment area
